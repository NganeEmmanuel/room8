# Real Estate House-Hunting Application

## Project Description
This project aims to provide a real estate house-hunting solution that enables individuals, particularly students and low-income earners, to find suitable roommates and shared accommodations. The platform allows users to list available rooms, search for roommates based on preferences, and manage bids on listings.

The application is designed using a **microservices architecture**, ensuring scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. It consists of a **React-Vite frontend** and a **Java Spring Boot backend** with multiple microservices. The deployment is handled using **CI/CD pipelines and cloud-based VPS hosting**, ensuring high availability and automated updates.

## Project Impact
- **Affordable Housing**: Helps students and low-income individuals find affordable shared accommodations.
- **Efficient Matching**: Uses advanced search and recommendation algorithms to connect compatible roommates.
- **Security & Verification**: Implements authentication and fraud detection to ensure a safe user experience.
- **Automation**: Simplifies roommate search and agreement management through digital workflows.

## Overall Architectural Overview
The project follows a **microservices-based architecture**, where different services handle distinct functionalities. The key components include:

### 1. **Frontend** (React-Vite)
- Developed using **React.js** with **Vite** for fast builds and optimized performance.
- Implements a **component-based architecture**, ensuring reusability and maintainability.
- Communicates with the backend via **RESTful APIs**.
- Uses **React Router** for navigation.

### 2. **Backend** (Spring Boot Microservices)
- Built using **Spring Boot** and follows a **microservices architecture**.
- Implements communication between microservices using **Spring Cloud Feign Clients**.
- Service discovery is managed by **Spring Cloud Eureka**.
- API gateway uses **Spring Cloud Gateway** for request routing.
- Authentication is handled using **Spring Security and JWT**.
- Uses **PostgreSQL and MongoDB** for data storage.

### 3. **DevOps & Deployment**
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implemented using **GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and ArgoCD**.
- **Containerization**: Uses **Docker** to package and deploy services.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes is used for managing containerized applications.
- **VPS Setup**: The application is hosted on a **Cloud VPS**, configured using **Terraform**.

## Backend Architecture
The backend consists of several microservices, each handling a specific functionality:

### **1. API Gateway**
- Serves as the entry point for all requests.
- Routes requests to appropriate microservices.
- Ensures security and rate limiting.

### **2. Service Registry**
- Uses **Eureka Server** for service discovery.
- Allows services to register and locate each other dynamically.

### **3. Authentication Service**
- Handles user authentication and authorization.
- Uses **JWT tokens** for secure communication.
- Uses Redis for temporal token storage and management
- Integrates with **Spring Security**.

### **4. User Service**
- Manages user profiles and preferences.
- Stores user data in **MYSQL**.

### **5. Listing Service**
- Manages property and roommate listings.
- Uses **MSQL** for storage of listings.

### **6. Bid Service**
- Manages tennant bids on listings.
- Uses **MYSQL** for storage of listings.

### **7. Feedback Service**
- Handles user reviews and ratings.
- Uses **MYSQL** to store feedback data.

### **8. Search Service**
- Provides search functionality for rooms and roommates.
- Uses **Elasticsearch** for fast querying.
